Screenshot Maker allows you to take screenshots by selecting the desired area and save it to the desired directory with the desired extension (png, jpeg).
There is an option in the menu to configure the default directory and file extension, which allows you to save a screenshot with these settings at the click of a button.
You can also change the keyboard shortcut for activation.

C++ version 17 or later.
For OS Windows
